// ADR 0010 phase 13.8. The `workload_class` → `capabilityFloor` seam.
//
// ADR 0011 leaves "the `workload_class` → `capabilityFloor` mapping table" as an
// open item. This supplies it — but not as a table. Three things about the
// vocabulary, all checkable against `CANDIDATE_STACKS` rather than argued from
// the class names, make a hand-authored column the wrong shape:
//
//   1. The floors are *derivable*. A class's honest floor is the band its
//      authored lead already occupies: "do not go below what this class leads
//      with today" is exactly the migration guarantee, and it is a fact about
//      the stack, not a judgment. Authoring the numbers instead would repeat
//      13.9a's failure — a hand-maintained scalar beside the data it claims to
//      summarize, free to drift from it.
//   2. runner-routing-v4 owns a closed nine-cell difficulty × volume vocabulary.
//      The floor is still derived from the authored lead so matrix changes cannot
//      drift from a second hand-maintained scalar table.
//   3. The class only means anything on one route. `candidateStackForRoute`
//      matches on `workloadClass` for `implement.workspace-write.v1` and ignores
//      it everywhere else. A route-free table would invent a floor on the three
//      routes that have never honored the class.
//
// So the mapping resolves the class through the same compiled stacks routing
// already uses, and reads the floor off the resulting stack. Every property below falls
// out of that rather than being asserted beside it.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no environment, no clock. The snapshot arrives as an argument,
// including its absence.
