// ADR 0010 phase 13.4. `select()` — the pure function that turns a registry, a
// capability snapshot, a budget ledger, and an availability view into an ordered
// stack of rungs, replacing the hand-authored `CandidateStack.candidates`.
//
// It runs observationally under the runtime's `routing-shadow.ts` and drives the
// control plane's simulator and counterfactual replay through `evaluateRouting`.
// Shared here so both planes call the identical function.
//
// Purity is a contract, not an aspiration: no I/O, no environment reads, no clock.
// Every time-dependent value arrives through `inputs`. Note the sharpest edge —
// the runtime's `RootBudgetLedger` carries a `clock` field, and calling it would silently break
// determinism for a fixed input tuple. Only `ledger.remaining.cost` is read here,
// and a test passes a ledger whose clock throws to keep that honest.
//
// Step 7 (lead-backend coherence) is phase 13.4a and now runs — but only when the
// caller supplies a `leadPolicy`. Without one the stage does not execute and the
// three explanation fields it owns stay *omitted* rather than defaulted to
// `false`: an absent field says "not evaluated", where `false` would attest to a
// check that never ran.
